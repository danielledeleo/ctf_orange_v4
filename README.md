ctf_orange_v4
=============

The classic 2008 Team Fortress 2 map resurrected. 

Note about versioning
---------------------
ctf_orange_v4.vmf is the original map from 2008. It is untouched for the sake of nostalgia.
v4c is a "fixed" version also from 2008.
From this point forward, the highest letter is the latest version.
